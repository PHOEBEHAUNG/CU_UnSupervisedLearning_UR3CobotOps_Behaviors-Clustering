# CU_UnSupervisedLearning_UR3CobotOps_Behaviors-Clustering
UR3 CobotOps is a dataset that contains time-series data from a collaborative robot (cobot) performing various tasks. The dataset includes sensor readings, joint positions, and other relevant information that can be used for analysis and modeling.  
__I want to perform clustering analysis on this dataset to identify different operational behaviors of the cobot.__  

This repository includes the ipynb file to show my work and one report pdf to demonstrate the result.
